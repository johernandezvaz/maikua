    content: "At Sapphirus, we knew it was time to take the next step and go digital, but we didn't have a clear understanding of how to get started. That's when we met Maikua, and from the first contact, we knew we were in good hands. Their team provided us with consistent, clear, and friendly advice. Throughout the entire process of building our website, communication was impeccable. They listened to our needs, guided us patiently, and proposed solutions that truly fit our brand. Thanks to them, today we have a functional and professional e-commerce platform that will allow our customers to purchase directly from the comfort of their homes, without needing to visit a physical store. This advancement represents a huge benefit for our business and a new way to connect with those who choose us. We are incredibly grateful to Maikua for supporting us in this digital transformation process. Without a doubt, their commitment and experience made the difference.",

    content: "At La FÃ¡brica de Sabores, managing our expenses, orders, and profits with Excel sheets was becoming increasingly inefficient, especially because we couldn't always access the information from our phones. We needed a more practical and agile solution. That's when we turned to Maikua to develop a custom mobile application. The result exceeded our expectations. The application is not only easy to use but also allows all our employees to access information in real-time. This has significantly improved our organization and efficiency. We are delighted with Maikua's service and professionalism."
